## Setup

If you want to run these notebooks, you'll need to set up some credentials with [Google Cloud Translation](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/quickstarts) and you'll need to download the appropriate [Chrome webdriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) for your version of Chrome.

Install these packages at a minimum:
 - Jupyter Notebooks (or the Anaconda stack)
 - Selenium
 - Google Cloud Translate
 - ipyplot
